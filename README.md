# Thermostat
Thermostat app which uses geolocation and the OpenWeatherMap API. Being our first time using javascript the aim of this project was to learn the fundamentals of the language and produce a functioning app. Code was written with a test-driven approach using Jasmine for testing purposes, with a HTML/CSS user interface.

### Setup

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rskyte/thermostat
$ cd thermostat
```

To use the app open the ./src/thermostat.html file in any browser:

![user experience](/public/thermostat.gif?raw=true)

#### Running tests

Open the SpecRunner.html file in any browser. Expected output:

![test output](/public/tests.png?raw=true)
